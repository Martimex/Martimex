Hello World!

I am  beginner JavaScript coder. I began my programming journey on 14.06.2020.
My first language was C++, where I've learned a lot about basics of programming
aswell as building my very first projects. Starting off with JavaScript on 03.09.2020
I am continuously learning this language (along with some HTML and CSS stuff) and
thats really exciting experience.
